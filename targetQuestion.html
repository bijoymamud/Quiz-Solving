            What is the difference between map, filter, forEach and find ?

              forEach:</span
            >
            <br />
            .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an
            array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. <br />
            let food = ['mango','rice','pepper','pear'];
            food.forEach(function(foodItem) { <br />
            console.log('I want to eat '+foodItem); });
          </p>
          <br />

            >
              map():</span
            >
            <br />
            .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and
            returns a new array with the updated elements. <br />
            let cost = [100,400,300,700]; <br />
            let newCost = cost.map(function(costItem){ <br />
            return costItem / 10; }); <br />
            console.log(newCost);
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            <span
              class="font-semibold text-green-600 underline underline-offset-4"
              >filter():</span
            >
            <br />.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets
            a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that
            return truthy for the criteria. <br />
            let cost = [100,400,50,40,700]; <br />
            let smallCost = cost.filter(function(costItem){ <br />
            return costItem < 200 }); <br />
            console.log(smallCost);
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <span
              class="font-semibold text-green-600 underline underline-offset-4"
              >.find()</span
            >
            <br />
            Function .find() is also a search function like the previous but
            they differ in one small detail â€” this function returns only one
            match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the
            function will return the first that has matched.

            What is the difference between Local Storage, Session Storage and
            Cookies ?
          </h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            <span class="font-semibold text-green-600">Local storage</span> is
            the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger amounts of data to
            be stored, but the data is not deleted when the browser is closed.
            Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to
            access later, such as offline data. <br />
            localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <span class="font-semibold text-green-600">Session storage</span> is
            similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the current
            session. This means that the data will be deleted when the user
            closes the browser. Session storage is useful for storing data that
            is sensitive, such as login credentials. <br />
            sessionStorage.setItem("name", "tutorialsPoint");<br />
            var name = sessionStorage.getItem("name");
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <span class="font-semibold text-green-600"> Cookies</span> are the
            oldest and most well-known mechanism. They are simple to use and
            well supported by browsers. However, they are limited to 4KB of data
            and are often used to store data that is not sensitive, such as user
            preferences.
            <br />
            document.cookie = "name=tutorialsPoint";

          <h3 class="font-bold">What is eventLoop and how does it works?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The event loop is a crucial part of the JavaScript runtime that is
            responsible for handling asynchronous events in a single-threaded
            environment. It is the mechanism by which JavaScript code can
            execute non-blocking I/O operations, such as reading or writing to a
            file or making an HTTP request, without freezing the entire program.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h1 class="font-semibold">
            Here is a high-level overview of how the event loop works:
          </h1>
          <ol class="p-4">
            <li>
              <span class="font-bold">1.</span> The event loop constantly checks
              for new events in the event queue. An event could be something
              like a timer expiring, a network request completing, or a user
              clicking a button.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="font-bold">2.</span> When an event is detected, the
              event loop will execute the associated callback function(s) and
              remove the event from the queue.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="font-bold"> 3.</span> If there are no events in the
              queue, the event loop will wait until a new event is added.
            </li>
          </ol>

            Description of quizTimer and chooseQuiz function.
          </h1>
          <br />
          <p class="font-semibold text-green-500 underline underline-offset-4">
            quizTimer:
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The function takes one parameter called
            <span>"dismiss"</span>. If dismiss is true, the function clears the
            timer and returns. Otherwise, the function sets up a timer that
            updates the timer every second.Within the timer function, the code
            calculates the number of minutes and seconds remaining based on a
            count variable, which represents the number of seconds elapsed since
            the timer started.Overall, this function can be used to create a
            countdown timer with dynamic text color that can be dismissed by
            passing in true as the dismiss parameter.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="font-semibold text-green-600 underline underline-offset-4">
            chooseQuiz:
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This function called <span>"chooseQuiz"</span> that takes two
            parameters: <span>"index"</span> and <span>"givenAns"</span> .f an
            object with the same ID exists, it updates the givenAns property of
            that object with the new answer provided in the givenAns
            parameter.If the object with the same ID does not exist in the
            answers array, it creates a new object with the quiz question's data
            and the answer provided in the givenAns parameter and adds it to the
            answers array.Finally, the function calls another function called
            displayAnswers with the updated answers array to show the updated
            list of quiz questions and their respective answers.
